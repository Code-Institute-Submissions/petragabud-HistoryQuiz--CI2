This is my 2nd CI project - it is focused on JS.
The idea was to create a History quiz with Correct and Incorrect answer options (and a score tracker); the site also has a Contact us and feedback option.
The JS for some reason is not displaying the questions and I have tried researching how to fix it but it has not been sucessfull.
The site is mobile functional.
The reasources which I used for inspiration were CI Love Maths walkthrough and codeboxx.com (quiz maker tutorial).
